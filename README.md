# DentAid

DentAid is a deep learning solution to better diagnose oral disease, and to help a dentist make more accurate and faster diagnosis.

Radiographs in dentistry can help dental practitioners diagnose a number of oral and maxillofacial diseases and prescribe appropriate treatments and interventions based on that diagnosis. However, radiographs are also often difficult to read and present a number of challenges to dentists and diagnosticians when determining abnormalities.

Our project aims to use Deep Learning techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks to build classifiers that can accurately detect certain oral and maxillofacial diseases. The diseases include caries, cysts and tumors as well as diagnosing incorrect root canal treatments. We will also apply various other image processing steps to annotate the test OPG with teeth numbering, teeth segmentation, gender detection etc
